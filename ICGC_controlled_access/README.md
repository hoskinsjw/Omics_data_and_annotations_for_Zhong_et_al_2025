# ICGC Data (Controlled access thru ICGC ARGO)

This folder contains citation metadata and links to data access instructions for the ICGC WGS data originally published in Bailey P et al. "Genomic analyses identify molecular subtypes of pancreatic cancer" Nature (2016) and Rheinbay E et al. "Analyses of non-coding somatic drivers in 2,658 cancer whole genomes" Nature (2020), but also used in our multi-omics study Zhong et al., "Large-scale multi-omic analysis identifies noncoding somatic driver mutations and nominates ZFP36L2 as a driver gene for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma" (In revision at Gut).
