# HiChIP-seq Data (GEO)

This folder contains citation metadata and accession information for the ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq datasets originally published in Arda et al., "A chromatin basis for cell lineage and disease risk in the human pancreas." Cell Syst. (2018), but also used in our multi-omics study Zhong et al., "Large-scale multi-omic analysis identifies noncoding somatic driver mutations and nominates ZFP36L2 as a driver gene for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma" (In revision at Gut).
