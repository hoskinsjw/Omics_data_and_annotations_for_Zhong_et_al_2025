# PanCuRx Data (Controlled access through EGA)

This folder contains citation metadata and links to the controlled access PanCuRx WGS PDAC tumor data originally published in Chan-Seng-Yue M et al. "Transcription phenotypes of pancreatic cancer are driven by genomic events during tumor evolution" Nature Genetics (2020), but also used in our multi-omics study Zhong et al., "Large-scale multi-omic analysis identifies noncoding somatic driver mutations and nominates ZFP36L2 as a driver gene for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma" (In revision at Gut).
